# Death's Door

When your character hits 0 **HP**, they are at **DEATH'S DOOR**. You will have to make a **NORMAL** roll sometime soon to determine the fate of your character. If your character does not survive, that is ok. Make sure to discuss potential plans for a new character and establish what kinds of things you want to happen in the case of a character death. If there's a **SKILL** your character has that activates on death, you have to play it before rolling **DEATH'S DOOR**.

Here are the consequences of a **DEATH's DOOR** roll. (FAILURE is below chart)

###### SUCCESS:  
You have escaped the clutches of the reaper for now. You return to life with 1 HP.

###### SNAG:  
Look at your highest ATTRIBUTE (or ATTRIBUTES if they tie) and choose a corresponding option or the standard bargain on the Death's Bargains Chart. You also return to life with 1 HP. You can’t take the same bargain twice unless it’s the Standard Bargain.

###### FAILURE:  
Your character does not get back up once they drop. They might not die right now but they will soon. Make what little time they have left count.

## Death’s Bargains

|Attribute Requirement|Name of Bargain|Consequence of Survival|
|---|---|---|
|**None**|Standard Bargain|Roll a d6. Reduce the corresponding **ATTRIBUTE** by 1. (1-2)**MIND** (3-4)**BODY** (5-6)**MAGIC**|
|**MIND**|Ignorance is Bliss|Your experience cap is reduced by 2d10. You are healed the same amount. (If you've already exceeded your new cap, you still retain your skills but not your excess xp.)|
|**BODY**|Fight or Flight|When **FAILING** or **SNAGGING** a roll could result in death, roll another d6 beforehand. On a 1-3; you **LOSE LEVERAGE**, on a 4-6; you **GAIN LEVERAGE**|
|**MAGIC**|Reverent Promise|If you knowingly tell someone a falsehood, or lie, you receive 1 damage that ignores armor.|
|**MIND**|Superstitious|Whenever you get a 4 on a **MIND** roll, your next roll **LOSES LEVERAGE.** If you get a 7 instead, you **GAIN LEVERAGE**|
|**BODY**|Overexerted|You are capable but at risk of exhausting yourself. When you **SNAG** or **FAIL** a **BODY** roll, make a choice. Either take 1d6 damage or make your next **BODY** roll with **LOST LEVERAGE.**|
|**MAGIC**|Arcane Exposure|Your magic keeps you alive but leaves you strained. Forget 1d4 Magical Skills or Spells of your choice. You can't buy these again with **XP**.|
|**MIND**|Nature's Price|You survive but are forever changed. Whenever you are interacting with animals, roll with **LEVERAGE**. Whenever you are trying to persuade, convince, deceive or act sociably with people, you **LOSE LEVERAGE**.|
|**BODY**|Grave Injury|Your rippling muscles were strained beyond total recovery during your near death experience. Whenever you **FAIL** a **BODY** roll, take 2 damge.|
