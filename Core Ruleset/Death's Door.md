# Death's Door

When your character hits 0 **HP**, they are at **DEATH'S DOOR**. You will have to make a **NORMAL** roll sometime soon to determine the fate of your character. If your character does not survive, that is ok. Make sure to discuss potential plans for a new character and establish what kinds of things you want to happen in the case of a character death. If there's a **SKILL** your character has that activates on death, you have to play it before rolling **DEATH'S DOOR**.

Here are the consequences of a **DEATH's DOOR** roll. (FAILURE is below chart)

###### SUCCESS:  
You have escaped the clutches of the reaper for now. You return to life with 1 HP.

###### SNAG:  
Look at your highest ATTRIBUTE (or ATTRIBUTES if they tie) and choose a corresponding option or the standard bargain on the Death's Bargains Chart. You also return to life with 1 HP. You can’t take the same bargain twice unless it’s the Standard Bargain.

###### FAILURE:  
Your character does not get back up once they drop. They might not die right now but they will soon. Make what little time they have left count.

## Death’s Bargains

|Associated Attribute|Name of Bargain|Consequence of Survival|

|**None**|Standard Bargain|Roll a d8. Reduce the corresponding **ATTRIBUTE** by 2. (1)**CLEVER** (2)**DEXTROUS** (3)**GRACE** (4)**IRREVERENT** (5)**MAGICAL** (6)**MARTIAL** (7)**NATURAL** (8)**STRONG**|
|**CLEVER**|Brain Drain|Your experience cap is reduced by 2d10.|
|**DEXTROUS**|Paralyzing Fear|When you encounter the same weapon, person, or situation that nearly killed you, roll **WITHOUT LEVERAGE** when **DEFENDING** if **FAILURE** could result in death.|
|**GRACE**|Reverent Promise|If you knowingly tell someone a falsehood, or lie, ROLL DEATH'S door again. If you choose the GRACE option again, on a SNAG, receive 1d10 damage instead (if this triggers another **DEATH's DOO**R roll, so be it).|

|**MARTIAL**|Overexerted|You are capable but at risk of exhausting yourself. When you **SNAG** or **FAIL** a **MARTIAL** roll, make a choice. Either take 1d4 damage or make your next MARTIAL roll with **LOST LEVERAGE.**|
|**NATURAL**|Nature's Price|You survive but are forever changed. Whenever you are interacting with animals, roll with **LEVERAGE**. Whenever you are trying to persuade, convince, deceive or act sociably with people, you **LOSE LEVERAGE**.|
