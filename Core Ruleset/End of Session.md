# End of Session

At the end of every Adventum session the AL should conclude your rousing story with a few questions. Depending on what happened during the game, you and your party might earn extra experience which they can spend now or use during the next session. First, we have individual questions per character, and then Party questions for all the heroes at the table.

## Individual questions

- Has your character acted on their motivation?
- Has the NATURE of any of your marked Relationships change?
- Has the INTENSITY of any of your marked Relationships change? (If your INTENSITY flipped then you get 2 XP)

Each of these questions can reward an individual character 1 **XP** if answered "yes" (and are justified to the AL).

You can have have a maximum of 5 written relationships at a time. You can remove a written relationship at any time. If your relationship another character isn't written, that's fine. Written relationships are simply relationships that you want to focus on for narrative or social bonuses.

## Party Questions

- Have we learned anything useful?
- Have we obtained a rare or special item? (Or crafted an Item with a Tier 5 effect?)
- Have we defeated a notable or powerful enemy?
- Have we completed an important quest?
- Have we made an important ally?
- Have we done a good deed (or punished one)?
- Have we solved a problem?

Everyone in the adventuring party receives 1 **XP** to any party question answered "yes" (and justified to the AL).
