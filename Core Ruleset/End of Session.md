# End of Session

At the end of every Adventum session the AL should conclude your rousing story with a few questions. Depending on what happened during the game, you and your party might earn extra experience which they can spend now or use during the next session. First, we have individual questions per character, and then Party questions for all the heroes at the table.

## Individual questions

- Have you acted on your motivation?
- Did you **INVOKE** any relationships? (Did you have a special interaction with a character you have a written relationship with?)

Each of these questions can reward an individual character 1 **XP** if answered "yes".

You can only report 1 **INVOKING** of a relationship per session. You have have a max of 5 written relationships at a time. When a relationship has been invoked, erase it to free a relationship slot. You canâ€™t use that character in a relationship slot again unless your relationship has changed.

## Party Questions

- Have we learned anything useful?
- Have we obtained a rare or special item?
- Have we defeated a notable or powerful enemy?
- Have we completed an important quest?
- Have we made an important ally?

Everyone in the adventuring party receives 1 **XP** to any party question answered "yes".
