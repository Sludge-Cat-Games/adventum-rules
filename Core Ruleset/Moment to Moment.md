# Moment to Moment

Most of Adventum is played with a pretty loose and narrative sense of time. Minutes can be twice as long in game as they are in real life and days of travel can be summarized in a few sentences. However, there are some times where every second counds, and that's when we enter Moment to Moment gameplay.

## Wait, I Don't Need to Roll Intiative?

Moment to moment is simple but it works better when everyone is on the same page. When moment to moment action begins, every adventurer has the opportunity to take an action that requires 1 roll. Once that action is completed, the rolling player has had their moment. Everyone needs to have their moment once before the AL lets the environment have their moment. If this is a horde, multiple characters or a boss, they always have the opportunity to act independently.

Failed or SNAG rolls that trigger environment or enemy actions don't count towards the environment's moment.

Once every adventurer and the environment have had their moment, then an adventurer can have their moment again.

If you want to coordinate actions, feel free to go in any order you like. 

If a player is controlling multiple characters, they can only use one of the characters for their moment. (Unless they have an action that gives one of their characters two moments.)
