# Moment to Moment

Most of Adventum is played with a pretty loose and narrative sense of time. Minutes can be twice as long in game as they are in real life and days of travel can be summarized in a few sentences. However, there are some times where every second counds, and that's when we enter Moment to Moment gameplay.

## Wait, I Don't Need to Roll Intiative?

Just like in regular play, there isn't a set order that players are meant to roll. However, to guarantee that every player has time to act, everyone is guaranteed a moment and they can't have another until everyone has had 1.

## It's YOUR Moment. Use it wisely

Each player gets a moment for every character in their control. A moment allows a character to take an action that requires a roll. If you have multiple moments, you can choose which characters you use them for. XP accrued by **FAILURE** can't be shared between characters.

## Out of the Spotlight
After every player has their moment, the AL will then give a moment to the an NPC (or NPC's) and then the environment. It is definitely possible for non player characters and entities to "act" before this, but only as the result of a player's roll. When all players have had their moment, the environment or NPC's act as appropriate and then all players get another moment to play.
