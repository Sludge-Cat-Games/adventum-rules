# XP Shop

In Adventum you gain XP through failure, relationships, and group experiences you go through as a party. You can use XP to make your character more versatile and powerful via **TALENTS**, **SKILL UP!'s**, and **TALENTS**.

**SKILL UP!â€™s** can increase proficiency in an **ATTRIBUTE**, ***TALENTS** half the cost of **SKILLS**. And of course, **SKILLs** empower your character to do cool stuff through new abilities.

_* Note: You can't stack discounts with **TALENTS**._
