# Item Shops

### While Adventum is inspired by medieval fantasy campaigns, it doesnâ€™t have to be played in one. Adventum campaigns are magical, but in the hopes of getting out of vaguely old Europe, the default items presented are best geared towards a modern magical campaign.

_(Item sets for other genres/settings are coming soon)_
