# Item Shop

While Adventum is inspired by medieval fantasy campaigns, it doesnâ€™t have to be played in one. Adventum campaigns are magical, but in the hopes of getting out of vaguely old Europe, the default items presented are best geared towards a somewhat modern feeling magical campaign.

_(Item sets for other genres/settings will soon be in development)_
