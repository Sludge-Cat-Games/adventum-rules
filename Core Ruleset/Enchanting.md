# Enchanting

Through careful dedication to magic rituals and reverence to the arcane, you have the gift to imbue regular objects with Magical Powers. Your blessings, enchantments, and curses bring magic into the world that spellcasters and alchemists can't. More than just a feat of magic, you can turn the mundane into the Arcane by creating Enchanted Items.

## Enchanted Items

Enchanted Items have Attunement Effects. These Effects can't be used until the item is attuned to. You can be ATTUNED to 1 + MAGICAL or HOLY items at 1 time.

### Attunement

Attunement usually requires the MAGICAL or HOLY ATTRIBUTE.

###### SUCCESS

You are successfully attuned to the item and can use its Attunement Effects.

###### SNAG

Your are attuned to the item but your grip is tenuous at best. Roll 1d6. You only have that many uses of the item's Attunement Effect before you have to attune again.

###### FAIL

Your ritual fails and you're unable to attune. The item rejects you, your next attempt to attune LOSES LEVERAGE, and you can't attempt to attune again until the next day.

###### CRIT

You're more than attuned to the object. You're SYNCHRONIZED. You have LEVERAGE whenever you're rolling to use an item you're SYNCHRONIZED with.

## Enchanting

To enchant an object, you need TIME to conduct a ritual, KNOWLEDGE of the rune required for the enchantment, and a compatible MAGIC SOURCE to power the enchantment. Also, when rolling to enchant an item, you wait until after you've spent the time doing rituals to see if it worked.

### Knowledge

You can only ENCHANT an object if you have KNOWLEDGE of an enchantable Effect. You can spend 5 XP to gain KNOWLEDGE of any HOLY skill. You can also gain KNOWLEDGE by expending 5 XP and destroying an ENCHANTED ITEM you are attuned to.

###### SUCCESS

At the end of your Ritual Period, you have successfully imbued your mundane object with the power of the Arcane. Your Energy Source is destroyed, embedded in your Enchanted item, or otherwise expended.

###### SNAG

You create your MAGICAL ITEM but have faltered somewhere in the ritual period. Decide where you went wrong:
- **Lack of Dedication:** Your item requires more time to become complete. Continue your ritual for 1d4 days and roll again at the end of the Ritual Period.
- **Lack of Precision:** Your rituals were carried out sloppily or without grace. Anyone who tries to ATTUNE to this item do so WITHOUT LEVERAGE.
- **Lack of Reverence:** You took the ritual for granted or lacked the respect and mindset enchanting requires. Your item develops a jinx in addition to its intended effects. Roll 1d6 on the Enchantment Jinx Table to determine what it is. The target of the jinx is whoever is attuned.

###### FAIL

You create a failed concoction. None of your intended Recipe Effects apply. Roll a Side Effect on the Concoction Side Effects Table instead.

###### CRIT

Your concoction output is doubled.

### How to make a Sleeping Potion (An example of Spellcrafting)

To concoct a Sleeping Potion you're going to need a few things.
- The Alchemy Skill (to be able to make concoctions)
- A Sleeping Potion Recipe Effect (Tier 5 Effect)
    - Which you can get with ⓜ 1200 (Sleepy Time Potion) & 5 XP
- ⓜ 500

1) Spend ⓜ 500 to gather the ingredients needed for the Sleeping Potion Effect
2) Choose a Method of Application. We'll choose **Breathe In**.
3) The Concoction's Dynamic Difficulty is: Application Cost - Effect Tiers + NATURAL or CLEVER. Breathe In (-3) - Tier 5 Effect (-10) = -13
4) We roll a 14 + NATURAL (which we'll say is +6) gives us 20 - our DD (-13). We get a 7, which just barely gives us a SNAG.
5) We'll choose the **Tainted** condition and roll on the Concoction Side Effects Table. We got a 2 (Weak), so our targets fall asleep for 5 minutes, instead of 10.
6) So now we have an "Weak Sleep Potion" that can make 1 person or up to 1d6 people fall asleep for 5 minutes.
