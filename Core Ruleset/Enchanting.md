# Enchanting

Through careful dedication to magic rituals and reverence to the arcane, you have the gift to imbue regular objects with Magical Powers. Your blessings, enchantments, and curses bring magic into the world that spellcasters and alchemists can't. More than just a feat of magic, you can turn the mundane into the Arcane by creating Enchanted Items.

## Enchanted Items

Enchanted Items have Attunement Effects. These Effects can't be used until the item is attuned to. You can be ATTUNED to 1+ GRACE items at 1 time. If the Attunement Effect has a success condition, use GRACE to roll for it. If not, it activates on attunement or at dawn. An Attunement Effect won't stack on itself.

### Attunement

Attunement usually requires the GRACE or MAGICAL ATTRIBUTE.

###### SUCCESS

You are successfully attuned to the item and can use its Attunement Effects.

###### SNAG

Your are attuned to the item but your grip is tenuous at best. Roll 1d8. You only have that many uses of the item's Attunement Effect before you lose the effect and you have to attune again.

###### FAIL

Your ritual fails and you're unable to attune. The item rejects you, your next attempt to attune LOSES LEVERAGE, and you can't attempt to attune again until the next day.

###### CRIT

You're more than attuned to the object. You're SYNCHRONIZED. You have LEVERAGE whenever you're rolling to use an item you're SYNCHRONIZED with.

### Knowledge

You can only ENCHANT an object if you have KNOWLEDGE of a certain Effect. You can spend 5 XP to gain KNOWLEDGE of any GRACE skill. You can also gain KNOWLEDGE by expending 5 XP and destroying an ENCHANTED ITEM you are attuned to. You automatically have KNOWLEDGE of any GRACE skill you know.

## Enchantment Tier Table

## Enchantment Jinx Table

|Number|Jinx|Description|
|---|---|---|
|1|Slightly Unnverving|You have -1 on all social rolls.|
|2|Burden|Roll 1d8. You have a -2 penalty on the corresponding ATTRIBUTE.\n1) CLEVER\n2) DEXTROUS\n3) GRACE\n4) IRREVERENT\n5) MAGICAL\n6) MARTIAL\n7) NATURAL\n8) STRONG|
|3|Parasitic|Decrease Max HP by 1d6. Can't be less than 1.|
|4|Unlucky|When you roll a 4 or 13, your next roll LOSES LEVERAGE.|
|5|Anti-Magic|All MAGICAL rolls LOSE LEVERAGE.|
|6|Complex|Multiple jinxes develop. Roll twice for both jinxes and add a roll for every 6 rolled.|

When rolling to enchant an item, use GRACE to see the results of your enchantment RITUAL. (You can only do this if you have the ENCHANTER Skill).

###### SUCCESS

At the end of your Ritual Period, you have successfully imbued your mundane object with the power of the Arcane. Your Sacrificial Items are destroyed, embedded in your Enchanted item, or otherwise expended.

###### SNAG

You create your MAGICAL ITEM but have faltered somewhere in the ritual period. Decide where you went wrong:
- **Lack of Dedication:** Your item requires more time to become complete. Continue your ritual for 1d8 days and roll again at the end of the Ritual Period.
- **Lack of Precision:** Your rituals were carried out sloppily or without grace. Anyone who tries to ATTUNE to this item does so WITHOUT LEVERAGE.
- **Lack of Reverence:** You took the ritual for granted or lacked the respect and mindset enchanting requires. Your item develops a jinx in addition to its intended effects. Roll 1d6 on the Enchantment Jinx Table to determine what it is. Your jinx activates on attunement and at the beginning of every day that you are attuned. The jinx effect goes away at the end of the day.

###### FAIL

You create a Jinxed Item and automatically attune to it. It doesn't have your intended affect. Roll on the Enchantment Jinx Table to find out what its Attunement Effect is. A Jinxed item is still considered and Enchanted Item.

###### CRIT

You may SYNCHRONIZE with your newly enchanted item, or the first attuner becomes SYNCHRONIZED if they get a SUCCESS.

### How to make a Staff of Soul Rending

To create a staff of Soul Rending you'll need:
- The Enchanting Skill
- A Bo Staff (Made of Wood)
- KNOWLEDGE of Spiritual Absorption
- 2 Enchanted Items (Or magical equivalent)

1) Sacrifice 3 Enchanted Items to the Ritual (Takes 3 days to make)
2) Choose an Attunement Effect. We're using Spiritual Absorption.
3) Spiritual Absorption is a Tier 3 Skill. We'll now wait 5 in game days to complete the ritual.
4) We'll now calculate the Dynamic Difficulty for Enchanting: The Skill we're using as our Attunement Effect is Tier 3, so the DD is -7. 
5) We rolled a 13 + GRACE (+4) = 17. The DD takes us down to 10. A SNAG.
6) We decided that our mistake was a Lack of Reverence. So we'll roll on the Enchantment Jinx Table. We got a 1, which gives us the Outcast Jinx.
7) We now have a Staff of Soul Rending, that also imposes a -1 on all of our Social rolls.
