# Session  
0 Part 1:  
Don’ts & Do’s

Before every campaign of Adventum, you will require a world for your adventures to take place in. And that can be done in your first session or session 0. While the full alpha ruleset will take a while to come out, hopefully, you can find some enjoyment in generating some interesting worlds for fun! Looking over the rules, you’ll see here that a LOT of initial world creation has less to do with the actual gritty details of the fiction and more about an agreement between the players. At the end of the day we’re all just playing pretend and any creative decisions made during play aren’t done by dice, but by people. And remember, we’re all just here to have fun!

## Don'ts and Do's

Before anything else, it is important to lay down a common understanding for what you do and don’t want to be in the adventure as a group. Before any details of the world get written down, the AL (Adventure Leader, or “Game Master”) should go to the back of the sheet, and starting with the highest roller start the Don’ts and Do’s.

### Don'ts

The Don’ts should be fairly straightforward. However, given the negative nature of pointing out things we don’t want, the AL should make sure to remind everyone at the table of a few key things.

- Everyone at the table respects each other and wants everyone else to have a good time.
    
- Making the game better for someone else should not ruin the game for you.
    
- At the end of the day, everyone is here to have fun.
    

The AL will begin by stating one thing they don’t want to see in the adventure. Starting with the highest roller, the AL will then ask each player “What is one thing you don’t want to see in the adventure?”. This likely will be the most uncomfortable part of session 0 (or the entire game). As long as everyone remains respectful, that is completely fine.

This part of the game will probably be where triggering subjects and material can be brought up. Some things brought up might be directly related to the lives and identities of the players bringing them up.

A player bringing up something that can possibly be triggering to them is not an invitation to interrogate or challenge why or how it makes them uncomfortable.

Remember, we’re all here to have fun, and the Don'ts section is merely meant to avoid unnecessary misery between people playing pretend. The more empathetic the players are to each other during this stage could save an argument or prevent an incident later on in the adventure.

And, of course, at any point in the adventure, the Don’ts (or Do’s) can be revisited or amended if things change.

After everyone has gone, it’s time to check in. During this check in, more Don'ts can definitely be added to the list if they couldn’t be mentioned before. It’s important that everyone at the table has a chance to be heard. Once everyone is aware and satisfied with the Don’ts list, it is now time for...

### Do's

The Do’s should be equally straightforward. The AL will begin by stating what they hope to get out of the adventure and write that down. Afterwards, the AL, starting with the highest roller and going clockwise (or down a list), should ask “What is one thing you want to see in this adventure?”. They should be given a moment to think about and add one thing to the Do’s list. Once they’ve contributed, go to the next person until everyone has spoken.

At this point, the AL should check in with everyone and make sure that everyone is happy with this Do’s list. The AL should make sure to mention that just because something is on the list doesn’t mean every player has to do it. For example, if one of the Do’s a player contributed was “Romance” and they’re interested in romantic subplots, that doesn’t mean that every player character needs to flirt with or pursue a romantic relationship. Adding “Romance” or “Romantic subplots” to the Do’s simply means that opportunities for romance should be present in the adventure.

During this check in, more Do’s can definitely be added to the list if they couldn’t be mentioned before. It’s important that everyone at the table has a chance to be heard. Once everyone is aware and satisfied with the Do’s list, it is now time for...

### When Don’ts and Do's Clash

Now, after going through both sections, you might find that a Don’t might intersect with a Do. Here are some things to remember when resolving these intersections.

### Don’ts have priority over Do’s.

If a Do seems to override a Don’t, it probably shouldn’t be there. There are always exceptions, however, in general, not being able to do one thing you like does not override ruining the game for someone else.

### Don’ts are specific. Do’s are flexible

In general, Don’ts will be asking for the omission of specific kinds of subject matter. A Don’t might be asking for a lack of gore. A Do might ask for a wartime setting for more involved and tactical battles. These intersect but you can definitely have a tactical adventure without describing every detail of an enemy’s dismemberment.

If a Do and Don’t seem to come into conflict, see if the Do is flexible enough to accommodate the Don’t before discarding it.

## Keep the dialogue open

As said before, there shouldn’t be a requirement for someone to explain or justify their Don’t beyond the fact that it wouldn’t be fun for them. This shouldn’t be an obstacle to discussion though. If the interests of two players seem to clash, the problem shouldn’t pit them against each other. Every person at the table is on one side, and the problem is on the other. Tackle it together.

## Leaving the Game

A very important thing to remember with Do’s and Dont’s is that not every game is for everyone. There might be a risque game that could be a blast between friends but would sour a pickup group between acquaintances. Maybe 4 people want a gritty low fantasy adventure but you really wanted to play a wacky Lizard wizard.

Sometimes, a Don’t removes a Do that could be most of a player’s motivation for play. A hard but necessary decision might need to be made if a game doesn’t seem right for you.

Deciding that a game is not for you doesn’t say anything about your character or invalidate your standing in the tabletop community.

Everyone at the table simply wants to have fun, and being miserable for the sake of group acceptance makes the game worse for everyone.

And you know what? You deserve a game where your Lizard Wizard can stretch her tail and strut her stuff. It’s their loss if you feel you need to leave the game. And now that we’ve gotten all of that out of the way, we can get to the actual word building.
