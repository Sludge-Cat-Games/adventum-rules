## Currently In Development

_Adventum is still under active development and the rules are not yet complete. Everything here is provided as is and will be (and this is an official term) very “jank”. However, I hope you can have fun even while I get this together._

# Summary

Adventum is a Table Top Role Playing Game (TTRPG) that uses a d20 to determine the outcomes of challenges in a 3 tiered system. You can succeed, run into a snag, or fail your way into mesmerising stories & wacky situations! Create a world and campaign together and discover adventure together!

# Why?

Do you want to make an elemental that can smell evil? A wizard that uses their spellbook as a melee weapon? A monk that’s also a Michelin start chef? You can do all that and more with the classless skill based character progression in Adventum!

Along with rules for creating and playing in a world you all make together, creativity is the limit to what and how you play in Adventum. So get your Barbarian Professor and Assassin Druid together to energy blast your way to adventure!
