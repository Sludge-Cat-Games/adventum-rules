# Alchemy

Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble your way to magnificent potions, pastries, & poisons. Through alchemy, you can create a variety of Magical consumables with a variety of effects.

## Recipe Effects

You can learn a recipe by expending 5 XP and analyzing a consumable with the Concoction tag. This uses up the consumable. Recipe Effects are recorded as the effects of a consumable. Each recipe is also associated with a Tier, which also gives the cost of raw ingredients.

## Concocting

To start concocting an alchemical creation, you simply need an Application Method, Recipe Effect (or Effects), and Ingredients *(or ⓜ)*  (You can only do this if you have the Alchemy Skill).

## Application Difficulty

|Application Method|Description|Difficulty|
|---|---|---|
|Ingest|The concoction must be consumed to confer its effects.|0|
|Topical Solution|The concoction must make contact to confer its effects. If splashed over  wider area, 1d4 people can be affected if they make contact.|-1|
|Breathe In|The concoction must be breathed in to confer its effects. If smelled by someone, the concoction is used up. If let out into an open area, it can affect 1d6 people near the cloud of breathable concoction.|-2|

## Recipe Tier Table

|Recipe Effect Tier|Difficulty|ⓜ|
|---|---|---|
|1|-2|ⓜ 100|
|2|-4|ⓜ 200|
|3|-6|ⓜ 300|
|4|-8|ⓜ 400|
|5|-10|ⓜ 500|

## Concoction Side Effects Table

|Number|Side Effect|Description|
|---|---|---|
|1|Skin Condition|Your skin changes color. Roll 1d4:\n1) Green\n2) Red\n3) Blue\n4) Purple\nIf this isn't a side effect, you can choose any color for the affected surface to change.|
|2|Weak|The concoction is nearly inert. Halve its numerical effect. If it doesn't have one, the AL determines how the weakened effect is expressed.|
|3|Stinky|You start to emit a rather unsavory odor that can't be washed away. You continue to smell until you rest or are cured of your illness.|
|4|Sickened|Your rolls have -1 until you rest or are cured of your sickness.|
|5|Neutralized|Your concoction has no other effects. It also neutralizes the effects of other concoctions when mixed or applied.|
|6|Complex|Your concoction has multiple side effects. Roll twice to get both effects (Roll again if you get 6 again).|


###### \n\nSUCCESS

You're able to craft a marvelous concoction with all the Spell Effects you desired.

###### SNAG

You successfully craft a concoction but you had to work around some difficulties. In addition to your intended effects, shoose one side effect:
1) **Poison:** Roll a d6; The affected target receives 1 damage for that many rolled actions.
2) **Reduced:** The application method is reduced by 1. *(Breathe in > Topical > Ingest)*. You can't choose this if its application is Ingest.
3) **Tainted:** Roll a Side Effect on the Concoction Side Effects Table.

###### FAIL

You create a failed concoction. None of your intended Recipe Effects apply. Roll a Side Effect on the Concoction Side Effects Table instead.

###### CRIT

Your concoction output is doubled.

### How to make a Sleeping Potion (An example of Spellcrafting)

To concoct a Sleeping Potion you're going to need a few things.
- The Alchemy Skill (to be able to make concoctions)
- A Sleeping Potion Recipe Effect (Tier 5 Effect). You can get this with ⓜ 1200 (Sleepy Time Potion cost) & 5 XP
- ⓜ 500 (the cost of Tier 5 ingredients)

1) Spend ⓜ 500 to gather the ingredients needed for the Sleeping Potion Effect
2) Choose a Method of Application. We'll choose **Breathe In**.
3) The Concoction's Dynamic Difficulty is: Application Cost - Effect Tiers + MIND. Breathe In (-3) - Tier 5 Effect (-10) = -13
4) We roll a 14 + MIND (which we'll say is +6) gives us 20 - our DD (-13). We get a 7, which just barely gives us a SNAG.
5) We'll choose the **Tainted** condition and roll on the Concoction Side Effects Table. We got a 2 (Weak), so our targets fall asleep for 5 minutes, instead of 10.
6) So now we have an "Weak Sleep Potion" that can make 1 person or up to 1d6 people fall asleep for 5 minutes.
