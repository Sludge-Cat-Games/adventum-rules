In Adventum, relationships aren’t only great flavor to contextualize your adventures. You can also mark them on your sheet to gain experience & get a bonus in certain social situations. To mark down a relationship on your character sheet, you need the name of the character you’re tracking, the **NATURE** of the relationship, & the **INTENSITY**.

## Nature

This is the quality of the relationship in question. Your cohort of choice could be your friend, coworker, teacher, therapist, bully, tap-dancing partner, co-parent (etc.)…

It doesn’t matter what this **NATURE** is. However, when the **NATURE** of a relationship changes, (_Enemy > Lover, Student > Teacher, Coworker > Friend_) you get **1 XP** at the end of session.

## Intensity

This is the magnitude of the relationship you’re marking on your sheet. **INTENSITY** not only informs how well acquainted and trusted you are, it reflects a bonus that becomes applied to Persuasion & Deception rolls with the character in question.

## Relationship Intensity Chart

|**Bonus**|**INTENSITY**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|+3|Confidante|You trust this person to a fault. When you speak to them, you know that you are free from judgement and can be properly understood.|
|+2|Peer|You recognize that you and this person have common ground. You see eye to eye and respect each other even when not explicitly shown.|
|+1|Acquaintance|You believe you get the overall vibe of this person and see them positively. You could deign to find out more about them, but leaving things as they are is both comfortable and pleasant.|
|+/-0|Stranger|You don't really have an opinion of this person. Or if you do, it's formed secondhand. They may not know who you are at all.|
|-1|Annoyance|You don't like this person. You can tolerate them if needed but minimizing your time together is preferable.|
|-2|Enemy|You and this person are at odds. Your positions are incompatible and you do not mesh well. You may not hate this person but you don't want them to succeed if it interferes with your goals.|
|-3|Anathema|To say you are wary of this person would be putting it softly. What they've done or what they stand for is reprehensible. If someone else likes or agrees with them, your opinion of this third party becomes soured|

If the **INTENSITY** of your relationship changes. You get **1 XP**. If a **DRASTIC** change from positive to negative (or vice versa), you get **2 XP** instead.

If you get a **NATURE** change as well as a **DRASTIC** **INTENSITY** change in the same session, you can get **3 XP.** From one of your marked relationships at the end of session.

**You can only get XP from one of your marked relationships per session.** But it’s still a good idea to track the progression of relationships as they confer social bonuses as well.

## Social Bonuses & Penalties

When you mark a relationship on your sheet, the **INTENSITY** of a relationship affects how good you are at persuading & deceiving the person of interest.

When persuading someone, simply add the **INTENSITY** **BONUS** to your roll. When deceiving someone, subtract the **INTENSITY BONUS** if the **INTENSITY** was positive, it’s now negative (and vice versa).

In a game heavy on politics, or when certain characters are deadlier as enemies, than as friends, being able to effectively use your bonuses to navigate social situations can be paramount to success.

Mind your relationships wisely. More importantly, however, have fun building connections with characters in your games!
