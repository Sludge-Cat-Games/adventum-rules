# Character Creation

Here are all pieces that make your beautiful, misunderstood, tragic OC alive and real in the world of Adventum. Make your character here and and refer to this guide to know what all the parts of your character sheet mean!

## Making a new Character

New characters have short list of things they need.
- A name
- Description
- 1 Talent
- 1 Skill
- And 5 XP to start out

*Optionally, you can also manipulate their ATTRIBUTES to make your character even cooler.*
Let's go through each of these items and build a new character!

### Name & Description

What they're called and what they look like (Make sure to talk to your AL if you want to do something aprticularly wonky and out there).

### Attributes

Your character has 8 ATTRIBUTES (Clever, Dextrous, Grace, Irreverent, Magical, Martial, & Natural) that define their abilities and aptitude with certain skills. If a skill you're using has SUCCESS conditions, you can roll using one of its associated ATTRIBUTES. Otherwise, the AL determines when you roll which ATTRIBUTE.

By default, you have +0 to all of your ATTRIBUTES. You can increase them by +2 by buying SkillUp!'s with XP in the [XP Shop](/xp-shop). The more SkillUp!'s you have under an ATTRIBUTE, the more expensive the next SkillUp! is. But there's another way to buff your ATTRIBUTES without spending XP.

### Stat Manipulation

You can increase any of your ATTRIBUTES by up to +2. However, you must subtract your increase to another ATTRIBUTE. There is no limit to how low you can decrease a stat, so feel free to dump to your heart's content (Just be careful)! Does this mean you can increase every stat by 2 except for 1? YES! Does that make that one stat your glaring weakness? ALSO YES! Choose wisely when manipulating your stats.

### 1 Free Talent

Talents halve the cost of Skills that share the Talent's ATTRIBUTE. Normally, Talents cost 25 XP. But when making a new character, you get 1 for free! Skills might have more than 1 ATTRIBUTE, but you can't increase a discount with multiple TALENTS. Every skill is either 50% or 0% off. No exceptions!

### Skills & XP

You can choose any 1 Skill as long as it isn't a Tier 5 Skill. You'll need to pony up the XP for those. You also get 5 XP that you can save for later or spend immediately on a Tier 1 Skill that became discounted from your free Talent. But how do you get XP?

Your main ways of earning XP will be through rolls. Every time you Fail a roll, you get 1 XP. You can also get XP from End of Session Questions, or Relationships.

## Relationships

Relationships are a great way to gain XP in Adventum. To define a relationship, write down the name of the character you want to mark down, the NATURE of the relationship and the INTENSITY of the relationship (With the ALâ€™s approval).
