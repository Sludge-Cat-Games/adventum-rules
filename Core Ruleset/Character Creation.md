# Character Creation

Here are all pieces that make your beautiful, misunderstood, tragic OC alive and real in the world of Adventum. Make your character here and and refer to this guide to know what all the parts of your character sheet mean!

## Making a new Character

New characters have short list of things they need.
- A name
- Description
- 1 Talent
- 1 Skill
- And 5 XP to start out

*Optionally, you can also manipulate STATS to make your character even cooler.*
Let's go through each of these items and build a new character!

### Name & Description

What they're called and what they look like (Make sure to talk to your AL if you want to do something aprticularly wonky and out there).

### Mind Body & Magic

Your character has 3 STATS, MIND, BODY, & MAGIC.

By default, you have +0 to all of your STATS. You can buy a +1 increase to any state with 10 XP.

### Stat Manipulation

When manipulating your STATS, you can take a point from one stat and add it to another. You can even make another STAT negative. You can't increase any 1 stat by more than 3, but there is no limit to how low you can decrease a STAT.

### 1 Free Talent

Talents halve the cost of skills that share the specified tag. Normally, Talents cost 25 XP. But when making a new character, you get 1 for free! S might have more than 1 tag, but you can't increase a discount with multiple TALENTS. Every skill is either 50% or 0% off. No exceptions!

### Skills & XP

You can choose any 1 Skill as long as it isn't a Tier 5 Skill. You'll need to pony up the XP for those. You also get 5 XP that you can save for later or spend immediately on a Tier 1 Skill that became discounted from your free Talent. But how do you get XP?

Your main ways of earning XP will be through rolls. Every time you Fail a roll, you get 1 XP. You can also get XP from End of Session Questions, or Relationships.

## Relationships

Relationships are a great way to gain XP in Adventum. To define a relationship, write down the name of the character you want to mark down, the NATURE of the relationship and the INTENSITY of the relationship (With the ALâ€™s approval).
