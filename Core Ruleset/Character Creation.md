# Character Creation

Here are all pieces that make your beautiful, misunderstood, tragic OC alive and real in the world of Adventum. Make your character here and and refer to this guide to know what all the parts of your character sheet mean!

## Name

Name your Character.

## Attributes

By default, all of your **ATTRIBUTES** are set to +0. You can increase any 1 **ATTRIBUTE** by 1 if you subtract 1 point from another. You can increase any **ATTRIBUTE** this way up to +2, but there is no limit to how low you can drop an **ATTRIBUTE** (so be careful). At the end of character creation, your starting **ATTRIBUTES** should average out to 0.

## XP

Now there are no levels in Adventum, but there are experience points (or **XP**). You gain **XP** through **SNAGGED** or **FAILED** rolls, fulfilling your **MOTIVATION**, and **INVOKING RELATIONSHIPS**. Every new character gets 25 **XP** by default to start with, and you can spend XP on…

### Talents

**TALENTS** cost 10 **XP** each and offer your character discounts on **SKILLS** that share a tag with it. For example, the “Disciplined” **TALENT** has the **MARTIAL** tag. So if your character buys “Disciplined”, every **SKILL** with the **MARTIAL** tag will cost half its usual **XP** cost.

You can’t stack discounts from **TALENTS,** but buying more of them gives will give you a wider pool of discounted **SKILLS**.

### Skill Up!’s

You can adjust your stats yourself when making a new character but you can only add +2 max and you have to subtract from other **ATTRIBUTES** to do so. Luckily, you can buy **SKILL UP!’s** to increase your **ATTRIBUTES** beyond +2 (and without subtracting from other skills). The higher you’re increasing an **ATTRIBUTE**, the more expensive the increase, and increasing an **ATTRIBUTE** from 0 starts at 10 **XP.**

You can spend XP on **SKILL UP!’s** to increase **ATTRIBUTES** but not on **ATTRIBUTES** directly

### Skills

Over the course of an adventure, your character can earn up to 200 **XP**. Any **SKILL** can be bought at and there is over 1600 **XP** worth of **SKILLS** that span 5 Tiers. Each successive tier’s **SKILLS** cost more than the last so make sure to take advantage of **TALENTS** for discounts!

## HP

Your character’s default **Max HP** is 10, but it can be increased with purchased **SKILLs**.

## Starting Equipment

By default your character has clothes, a bag to carry items, and 3 items from the starter items list. Any additional possessions need to be brought up and approved by the **AL**.

## Description

Your look, your vibe, your essence. All of these things and more can be written down to define your character as flavorfully or regularly as you please.

## Relationships

Relationships are a great way to gain XP in Adventum. To define a relationship, write down the name of the character you want to mark down, the **NATURE** of the relationship and the **INTENSITY** of the relationship (With the AL’s approval).

## Motivation

Finally, you have your characters’ motivation. This can be a general moral alignment, a special interest, or a goal that’s broader and more philosophical than what the plot can provide. Motivations might take a whole campaign to achieve or even longer. If you take actions that are emblematic of your motivation in a session, you gain 1 **XP**.
