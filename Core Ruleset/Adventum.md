What is adventure? Is it a call, at-first refused? A crossed threshold that will forever transform you? Is it a challenge, or even temptation? Whether it takes you to the deepest abysses or the most glorious heights. Or even just across the street into the arms of a dear friend.  
  
### The world may not stop for you, but adventure (and Adventum) awaits!

_(As of now, Adventum is still under active development and the rules are not yet complete. Everything here is provided as is and will be, and this is an official term, very “jank”. However, I hope you can have fun even while I get this together.)_

## What is Adventum?

Adventum is a Table Top Role Playing Game (TTRPG) that focuses on collaboration, character-creation freedom, & building on your characters’ mistakes, experiences, & relationships. Intended to be an approachable 1st TTRPG, we do away with classes, modules, and kill-only XP so you can have a memorable time at the table.

## Why play Adventum?

Do you want to make an elemental that can smell evil? A wizard that uses their spellbook as a melee weapon? A monk that’s also a Michelin start chef? You can do all that and more with the classless skill based character progression in Adventum!

Along with rules for creating and playing in a world you all make together, creativity is the limit to what and how you play in Adventum. So get your Barbarian Professor and Assassin Druid together to energy blast your way to adventure!
