# Rolling

## You Can (Almost) Always Try

When playing Adventum there will be many many MANY times where you want to do something with the chance of failure. When this happens, the **AL** will ask you to roll a d20, and the result will guide the **AL** to interpret what happens next.

## Success, Snags, & Failure

Whenever you roll to successfully complete an action, your result can be one of three Success States; Success, Snag, or Failure. On a **SUCCESS**, you are able to complete the action you wanted. On a **SNAG**, you usually complete your action with a consequence, or do a lesser or less effective version of the action. On a **FAILURE**, you do not succeed in completing your action and, more often than not, there are additional consequences.

### Success

To succeed on a roll, you need to get a 15 or higher.

### Snag

To snag a roll, you can get any number from 7 to 14.

### Failure

To fail a roll, you need a 6 or lower.

### Crit

When you succeed on a roll, you can get an elevated success if you get a 20 on the die (not the result). When a CRIT is achieved, your current dice pool is doubled. You can also spend XP points to upgrade a roll (before modifiers) to CRIT as well.

## Dynamic Difficulty

Now every action isn’t equally likely to succeed, snag, or fail. Some actions will vary in difficulty and that’s where Adventum’s **Dynamic Difficulty** (DD) comes in. When the **AL** asks you to roll, they will tell you what the **DD** type or let you know that it’s been set. The **DD** will either add or subtract from the roll, making it easier or more difficult. The **DD** levels the **AL** will use are as follows:

|Modifier|Difficulty|
|---|---|
|+25|Guaranteed|
|+20|Trivial|
|+15|Basic|
|+10|Simple|
|+5|Easy|
|+/-0|Normal|
|-5|Hard|
|-10|Difficult|
|-15|Challenging|
|-20|Severe|
|-25|Impossible|

The names should serve as a shorthand for how difficult an activity should be. Resetting a chain on a bike? Might be **EASY**(+5). Fighting a GOBLIN? **NORMAL** (+0). Convincing a wizard that your barbarian is a magical scholar? **IMPOSSIBLE** (-25).

## STATS

Characters in Adventum don’t have stats like in other RPG’s, but they do have the 3 core **STATS**; **MIND, BODY, & MAGIC**. **STATS** can be added to the **DD** if it applies to the roll.

**STATS** follow the same scaling as **Dynamic Difficulty**. Rolls that can utilize an **STAT** will add that **STATS** difficulty to the **DYNAMIC DIFFICULTY** that would normally be associated with that roll.

For example, let’s say that you need to convince a maester at a Wizard’s college that your Barbarian friend has a hidden talent for magic. The **AL** says that your character knows that this will be **DIFFICULT** (-10) given the circumstances but one of your party members has a high **MIND** attribute, and the skill Proselytize.

#### Proselytize
>
> _If an NPC you encounter has no opposing declaration of faith or philosophy, you have a chance to convert them to your belief system._
>
> ###### Success  
>
> You successfully convinced the NPC! Huzzah! You can now use the_ **_MIND+LEVERAGE_** when convincing, bluffing, intimidating or persuading the proselytized unless they no longer believe in your philosophy or religion._
>
> ###### Mixed Success  
>
> They see the wisdom of your belief system but remain agnostic. They are not converted but your next social roll with/against that NPC is_ **_EASIER_** _(+5). You cannot attempt to Proselytize this NPC again for a while._
>
> ###### Failure  
>
> You represent your philosophy poorly and their opinion is unchanged or yet worsened. Your next social roll with/against this NPC_ **_LOSES LEVERAGE_** _and you can never proselytize them again._

If your proselytizing party member has leveled up their **MIND STAT** to +6, and they succeed on their proselytization, and the skill grants them **LEVERAGE** in social situations.

**SKILLS** will say what **STAT** is needed for rolls. However, there are also broader actions that make use of **STATS**. For example:
- Rolls that require recalling information, figuring out a problem that you're specialized in, or trying to notice details or awareness use **MIND**.
- Rolls that require acts of physical strength, dexterity, or bodily constitution use **BODY**.
- Rolls that require direct interactions or utilization of magic (that isn't spellcasting), or when doing something that deals with the innate nature of your character uses **MAGIC**.

When rolling one of these general actions, the **AL** determines the consequences of a **SNAG** or **FAILURE.**

## **LEVERAGE**

Very simply, if you have **LEVERAGE** in a situation, you roll twice and take the higher result. If you **LOSE**, **LOST** or in a situation that **LOSES LEVERAGE**, you roll twice and take the lower result.

## Help

When your character is present and able to help another character with an action, you can contribute **XP** points from your pool to another character's roll. You can't **CRIT** a roll with "Help XP". Only the original roller can get double **XP** from a **CRIT**.

If possible, you can offer "Help XP" after someone has already rolled before the consequence.
