# Rolling

## You Can (Almost) Always Try

When playing Adventum there will be many many MANY times where you want to do something with the chance of failure. When this happens, the **AL** will ask you to roll a d20, and the result will guide the **AL** to interpret what happens next.

## Success, Snags, & Failure

Whenever you roll to successfully complete an action, your result can be one of three Success States; Success, Snag, or Failure. On a **SUCCESS**, you are able to complete the action you wanted. On a **SNAG**, you usually complete your action with a consequence, or do a lesser or less effective version of the action. On a **FAILURE**, you do not succeed in completing your action and, more often than not, there are additional consequences.

### Success

To succeed on a roll, you need to get a 17 or higher.

### Snag

To snag a roll, you can get any number from 7 to 16.

### Failure

To fail a roll, you need a 6 or lower.

### Crit

When you succeed on a roll, you can get an elevated success if you get a 20 on the die (not the result). The effects of Crits vary depending on the kind of action rolled, and at times, will be up to the **AL’s** discretion.

## Dynamic Difficulty

Now every action isn’t equally likely to succeed, snag, or fail. Some actions will vary in difficulty and that’s where Adventum’s **Dynamic Difficulty** (DD) comes in. When the **AL** asks you to roll, they will tell you what the **DD** type or let you know that it’s been set. The **DD** will either add or subtract from the roll, making it easier or more difficult. The **DD** levels the **AL** will use are as follows:

|Modifier|Difficulty|
|---|---|
|+10|Guaranteed|
|+8|Trivial|
|+6|Basic|
|+4|Simple|
|+2|Easy|
|+/-0|Normal|
|-2|Hard|
|-4|Difficult|
|-6|Challenging|
|-8|Severe|
|-10|Impossible|

The names should serve as a shorthand for how difficult an activity should be. Resetting a chain on a bike? Might be **BASIC**(+6). Fighting a GOBLIN? **NORMAL** (+0). Convincing a wizard that your barbarian is a magical scholar? **IMPOSSIBLE** (-10).

## ATTRIBUTES

Characters in Adventum don’t have stats like in other RPG’s, but they do have **ATTRIBUTES**. **ATTRIBUTES** are added to the **DD** to get the actual modifier for the roll. By default, characters start with no **ATTRIBUTES** but they can gain them when they learn a skill with those **ATTRIBUTE** types and skills. The **ATTRIBUTES** in Adventum are:

- **CLEVER**
- **DEXTROUS**
- **GRACE**
- **IRREVERENT**
- **MAGICAL**
- **MARTIAL**
- **NATURAL**
- **STRONG**

**ATTRIBUTES** follow the same scaling as **Dynamic Difficulty**. Rolls that can utilize an **ATTRIBUTE** will add that **ATTRIBUTES** difficulty to the **DYNAMIC DIFFICULTY** that would normally be associated with that roll.

For example, let’s say that you need to convince a maester at a Wizard’s college that your Barbarian friend has a hidden talent for magic. The **AL** says that your character knows that this will be **IMPOSSIBLE** (-10) given the circumstances but one of your party members has a high **CLEVER ATTRIBUTE** , and the skill Proselytize.

#### Proselytize
>
> _If an NPC you encounter has no strong declaration of faith or philosophy, you have a chance to convert them to your belief system._
>
> ###### Success  
>
> You successfully convinced the NPC! Huzzah! You can now use the_ **_GRACE_** _or_ **_CLEVER_ ATTRIBUTES _WITH LEVERAGE_** _when convincing, bluffing, intimidating or persuading the proselytized unless they no longer believe in your philosophy/religion._
>
> ###### Mixed Success  
>
> They see the wisdom of your belief system but remain agnostic. They are not converted but your next roll with/against that NPC is_ **_EASIER_** _(+2). You cannot attempt to Proselytize this NPC again for a long while._
>
> ###### Failure  
>
> You represent your philosophy poorly and their opinion is unchanged or yet worsened. Your next social roll with/against this NPC_ **_LOSES LEVERAGE_** _and you can never proselytize them again._

If your proselytizing party member has leveled up their **CLEVER ATTRIBUTE** to **BASIC** (+6), and they succeed on their proselytization, they take what was an **IMPOSSIBLE** situation and made it **DIFFICULT** (-10 to -4). And on top of that, the skill grants them **LEVERAGE** in social situations.

When an **ATTRIBUTE** is written on a **SKILL**, and you have to roll to utilize that **SKILL**, you can choose to use any of the listed **ATTRIBUTES**. However, there are also broader actions that make use of **ATTRIBUTES**.

|**Action**|**Description**|**Applicable Attributes**|
|---|---|---|
|Awareness|You are trying to detect something that would normally fall beneath your notice.|CLEVER, NATURE, MARTIAL|
|Defense|You are trying to reduce or completely avoid harm.|Tell the AL what you want to do. They will determine the appropriate ATTRIBUTE.|
|Figure It Out|You are attempting to understand something or solve a problem using your thoughts and experience.|CLEVER (You can substitute an ATTRIBUTE that's relevant to the problem at hand)|
|Hiding|You are attempting to be unseen, either by limiting your visibility or blending in with your environment.|CLEVER, DEXTROUS|
|Improvising|You're attempting to use an implement in a way it's not meant to be used, and it's not obvious what ATTRIBUTE is applicable otherwise.|CLEVER|
|Intimidating|As a manner of posturing or a show of force, you are subtly threatening someone to see your point of view.|STRONG, IRREVERENT, GRACE|
|Melee Attack|You are hitting someone close up, with your hands or a weapon that doesn't utilize a projectile.|STRONG, MARTIAL|
|Persuading|You are trying to change someone's mind or convince them of something.|CLEVER, (You can substitute any other ATTRIBUTE w/ AL approval)|
|Ranged Attack|You are aiming at a target to strike from afar with a projectile, or a long flexible instrument or or tool.|DEXTROUS, MARTIAL|
|Research|You are attempting to find an answer to a question and have access to relevant information.|CLEVER (You can substitute another ATTRIBUTE if it's relevant to the field of inquiry)|

When rolling one of these general actions, the **AL** determines the consequences of a **SNAG** or **FAILURE.**

## **LEVERAGE**

Very simply, if you have **LEVERAGE** in a situation, you roll twice and take the higher result. If you **LOSE**, **LOST** or in a situation that **LOSES LEVERAGE**, you roll twice and take the lower result.
